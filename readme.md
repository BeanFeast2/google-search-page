From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project game me a better handle on page positioning in general. I found that nav bars for me are easier done without lists. I learned that if I'm trying to put elements with an image super close together, it's best to make a table in html, they seem to fit closer together (this project: google images at page selecter at bottom). The icons at the pot right were a bit easier to manipulate the second time around. The a tag that wraps the mangifying glass is showing up in 2 places on my page and I can't seem to fix it. All in all good project for me and my skill level, learned a lot on google.
